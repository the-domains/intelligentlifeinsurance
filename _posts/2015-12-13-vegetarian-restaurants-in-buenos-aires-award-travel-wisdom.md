description: 'This past winter, we decided to spend five weeks living in an apartment in Buenos Aires. As we quickly found out, Argentina is known for a few things: tango, matte, wine and beef. A lot of beef. Before we arrived, almost everyone we talked to got excited telling us how amazing the beef was going to be.'
